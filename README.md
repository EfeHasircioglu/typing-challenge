# Technologies used
- Vanilla CSS and JS
# Features
- Levels
- WPM calculation
- Word highlighting
- Resetting
# Development process
At first, setting up the structure of the levels and text highlighting seemed a bit hard but after trying multiple solutions, it became a much better implementation than the first version of this project. 
# For the future
In the future, i want to reimplement this idea with React.js and other modern web tools and also implement letter-by-letter highlighting.
